# Conference ticket generator

![Design preview for the Conference ticket generator coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## IMPORTANT

1. Please do not use any third party libraries and/or frameworks to complete this task. The only tools you have at your disposal are:

- HTML (Make sure the page has correct, semantic markdown, with a favicon, page title and all the necessary meta tags needed for a basic web page)
- CSS (Try to do your best to organize your styles and if you can, try to avoid duplication of styles where possible)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript only, nothing apart from the built in capabilities of client-side JavaScript is needed to complete this task)

2. Do not worry if you don't create a 1 to 1 exact correspondence with the given design. The most important things in this task is showing your ability to:

- Write clean, understandable (and semantic for HTML) markdown, CSS and JavaScript
- Make the layout responsive - it should look good and be usable on both Desktop and Mobile devices
- Make the functionality work properly - the application should be usable, have good error handling and produce the expected result

3. Don't be afraid to research (Google, LLMs etc) for potential/partial solutions to specific things that you may get stuck on. The point is not for you to be able to create such layouts from scratch by heart, but rather **to be able to research, learn and understand the problems as well as their solutions**. \
   As long as you manage to solve the tasks at hand, while having a deep understanding on how and why they were implemented the way that they were - you will have done a great job.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out a Ticket generator for an imaginary Conference. Try to get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The image is the wrong format _(image size checking is optional)_
- Make sure the fields are accessible
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- Make sure the layout is responsive
- Add hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page (form fields, buttons, links etc.)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The content shown in the designs is located inside the `content.md` file.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. Again, a 1-to-1 correspondence is NOT required - try to give it your best estimate but try not to spend too much time on it.

All the required assets are in the `/assets` folder.

You can use either Google Fonts or locally hosted fonts.
There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

> Note: No need to worry too much about the background's design/assets. Can feel free to leave it as one color or add some minimal gradient, as it is not at all a crucial part of this task.

## Submitting the solution

Feel free to either create a GitHub or a GitLab repo and add me as a member of the project:

- [My GitHub profile](https://github.com/dshijakovskiTDL)
- [My GitLab profile](https://code.tdlbox.com/daniel.shijakovski)

After submission, feel free to ping me on Discord - I will review the task and promptly give you feedback on whether this assessment is passed or not.

If there are any questions, don't hesitate to write in the Discord chat, will do my best to answer any unclear topics.

Good luck and crush it! ðŸ’ª
